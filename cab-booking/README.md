# cab-booking (Uber, Ola, etc)

- Flow can be understood by `main.py` as the apis are not exposed as REST
- IDs are used for object for readability instead of UUID

## Scope of improvements

- [ ] Create trip request and then let drivers accept 
- [ ] Surge pricing
- [ ] Services for user and cab instead of using directly the repository
- [ ] Add controllers and expose REST apis
- [ ] Add authentication and permissions check
